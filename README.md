# im880b
Modifications to the example code provided by IMST, to put on run the iM880B-L module. Initially made in MS Windows, but intended to be extended on Unix based OS, and some microcontrollers.

Note: This repo are going to be merged in the ['-micro' repo](https://github.com/pylatesUD/im880b-micro). Use only to test the demo code in Windows. In the same way, the '-micro' repo are designed (at time) for the 8 bit PIC family from Microchip.
